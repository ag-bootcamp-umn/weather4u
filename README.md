# WEATHER-4-U

## Description
This weather app allows users to search for any location and display the current weather conditions at that location, as well as a five-day forecast.

The app is responsive, and allows users to choose between multiple cities with the same name.

The impetus for building this app is to provide a quick and easy way to look up weather conditions for the user's convenience. 

This project allowed me to work on making repeated API 'get' requests, parsing response data, and using the returned data to make further API 'get' requests.
It also afforded me the opportunity to practice filtering data, ensuring that state is kept current, and practicing jQuery for DOM manipulation.

## Installation
None required- this app may be run in the browser from its deployment on Github Pages (see below).

## Usage
The user can follow a simple and intuitive UI to search for a city using a single text input and button. Subsequent buttons will appear and guide the user's interaction.

## Deployment
Deployed on Github Pages:
